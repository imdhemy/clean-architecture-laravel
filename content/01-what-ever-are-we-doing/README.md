# Chapter 1: What Ever Are We Doing?

## Introduction

Hi there! I'm Mohamad Eldhemy, but everyone calls me **Dhemy**. I'm a software engineer and customer data expert focused
on turning raw data into meaningful, actionable insights. My work spans the full customer data lifecycle, from capturing
clean, structured inputs to designing models that reflect real-world relationships and behavior.

Pleased to make your acquaintance! We'll be spending some time together, as I'm supposed to teach you a bit about Clean
Architecture With Laravel. But enough about me, what about you? I'm hoping that you're at least a bit familiar with PHP,
have some experience with Object-Oriented experience, and you want to use Laravel to build better applications. You
don't have to be an [entomologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomology), you just need to know how find and kill
bugs in your code.

I won't assume that you have any prior experience with Clean Architecture, because we both know what happens when you
assume. I will, however, expect you have run into unmaintainable code before, a legacy codebase that needs to be
modernized, or a project that has become a nightmare to work on. If you haven't, then congratulations! You're one of the
lucky ones! Now that we have been introduced, let's cover what we will be doing in this chapter.

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce you to the concept of Clean Architecture. Now, there is a hype around the
AI, and most of the code is being generated by genies in the cloud, but I want you to lead the genie not the other way
around. If you let the genie lead you, you will end up with a mess of code that might be functional, but it won't be
maintainable. So, probably I'm preparing you to be one of those people who will clean the mess after the "Vide Coders"!

During our time together, we will employ some general programming principles, and refactoring techniques. But, I
promise, I won't belabor you with every guideline I've ever heard of. Instead, we'll be focusing on appreciating
tradeoffs and making informed decisions about when to apply certain principles and techniques.
